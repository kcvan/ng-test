<p>{{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ serverStatus }}
  with string interpolation or with a function {{ getServerStatus() }}
</p>
<!-- you can see that we are using string interpolation for the serverId
and the serverStatus. even though serverId is a number, it can easily
be converted into a string, which is what agular does
but what about for  'Server'? string interpolation
will recognize anything that outputs a string. that means you can
write single line functions or ternary expressions as long
as it outputs a string -->
